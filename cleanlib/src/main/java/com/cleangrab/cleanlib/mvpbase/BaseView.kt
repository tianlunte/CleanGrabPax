/**
 * Created by qingyun.wang on 2/10/17.
 *
 * for MVP:
 *
 * The Model holds the business logic of the application. It controls how data can be created,
 * stored, and modified.
 *
 * The View is a passive interface that displays data and routes user actions to the Presenter.
 *
 * The Presenter acts as the middle man. It retrieves data from the Model and shows it in the View.
 * It also processes user actions forwarded to it by the View.
